REQ-23 manifest/index.html consistency appears implemented and the publishing doc includes the requested exact PWA values (per the visible excerpt). For REQ-22, the diff summary claims full Bubblewrap flow + troubleshooting, but the provided doc content is truncated before any Bubblewrap commands/troubleshooting are shown, so those parts cannot be verified from the evidence. The diff also includes substantial unrequested game/theme changes unrelated to Play Store/TWA readiness.",

      "reason": "The diff summary asserts these sections exist, but the provided truncated content of PLAY_STORE_PUBLISHING.md only shows steps through the beginning of keystore creation and does not include any visible Bubblewrap commands, the exact error string, or the required troubleshooting/checklist content.
